# Test Footage

All of the Nuke tools here are fully functional in Nuke Non-Commercial. If you would like to test them out I have uploaded a selection of wide gamut scene-referred test images in exr format to a dropbox folder here: [Test Footage](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fdm7mtxj8w103cg/AADXWcS7KEDik85rIELLTCd6a). It contains 2k scene-linear images, mostly encoded in ACES AP0 colorspace. 

These images were acquired from the following open sources:

- [ACES Gamut Mapping Virtual Working Group Image Submissions](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u6z2a0jboo4vno8/AAB-10qcflhpr0C5LWhs7Kq4a)
